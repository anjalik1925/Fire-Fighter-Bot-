🚒 Firefighter Bot – Autonomous Fire Detection & Suppression
📌 Overview

Firefighter Bot is an autonomous robotic system designed for fire detection and suppression using Arduino UNO, flame sensors, servo motors, and water pumps. This bot detects fire using infrared flame sensors, navigates towards the source, and extinguishes the fire using a water pump. The goal is to enhance firefighting efficiency, reduce human risk, and improve emergency response times.
